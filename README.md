# What is a Product Designer? #
<br>

> ## Design is concerned with how things work, how they are controlled, and the nature of the interaction between people and technology. When done well, the results are brilliant, pleasurable products. 
> – Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things

### Product design focuses on the entire lifecycle of a product to shape how users interact with it. Especially in larger cities, the industry has seen substantial growth in recent years. 

Product design is a true digital renaissance position. Leveraging both UX and UI design strategies, product designers have eyes on the entire design process -- from ideation to creation to product shipment. Because Product Designers leverage both skillsets of research, information architecture, testing of UX professionals as well as the visual know-how of extending a brand in the interface design of UI Designers, it required almost twice the education and experience. 

Product Designers many times own aspects or all of each of these other job roles: 

*   Experience Designer (XD) or User Experience (UX) Designer \[Link back\]
*   Information Architect (IA) or Experience Architect (XA) \[Link back\]
*   User Interface (UI) Designer \[Link back\]
*   Interaction Designer (IX) \[Link back\]

A better way to look at this is through the lens of the product:

The way a product **feels**. Also known as **user experience (UX) design** for a product. This is the logic behind the product and what it's offering to the user and how it's making the user feel throughout that experience.

The way a product **behaves**. Also known as **interaction design** **(IxD)** for a product. This is what the product or interface does when the user interacts with it. Animations, transitions and haptic feedback are aspects to consider.

The way a product **looks**. Also known as **user interface (UI) design** for a product. Extending the brand into the interface of the product is key here. This would include considerations in typography, color, imagery, layouts, hierarchy, buttons, forms, etc.

The way a product is **structured** and how the content is **organized**. Also known as **information architecture** for a product. This is mapping how the user performs and completes a task, tracking from the beginning of their journey to the end. What information and experience they have along the path from point A to point B.

So what are some deliverables product designers own? On paper, any key deliverable from the beginning of the product lifecycle to its end are the responsibility of product designers. Some examples include:

*   Competitive Analysis
*   Journey Maps
*   Site Maps
*   Wireframes
*   Prototypes
*   User Testing Scripts
*   High Fidelity Designs
*   Design Systems

### **Part process architect, part user experience expert, part interface designer, Product Designers have touch points and responsibilities in:**

*   business strategy
*   research
*   process mapping
*   user experience design
*   content strategy
*   information architecture
*   visual design
*   user interface design
*   development
*   stakeholder presentations

by [Henry Wu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hellohenrywu/) (9 min read) Recently, I was fortunate enough to speak at HubSpot’s First Gen in Tech event where I had the chance to talk about what a Product Designer is and what they do at HubSpot. The event was extremely enlightening. Not only did I have the opportunity to inspire many of my future colleagues but I quickly learned that Product Design is shrouded in mystery outside of those who are already in tech. I was overwhelmed by the feedback and quickly learned there are many questions about what a Product Designer actually does.

by [Sarah Klein](http://sarah-klein.com/) (4 min read) One of the best things about working in technology is that things are always changing, including what tech folks’ job titles are. As a design professional, it can be easy to get confused by the different job titles du jour. So what’s the difference between a User Experience Designer and a Product Designer? I had an answer based on past conversations with peers in the field, but after some lightweight data collection and analysis, I was led to think differently.
