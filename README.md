# What is a Product Designer? 
<br>

> ## Design is concerned with how things work, how they are controlled, and the nature of the interaction between people and technology. When done well, the results are brilliant, pleasurable products. 
> – Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things

## Product design focuses on the entire lifecycle of a product to shape how users interact with it. Especially in larger cities, the industry has seen substantial growth in recent years. 

Product design is a true digital renaissance position. Leveraging both UX and UI design strategies, product designers have eyes on the entire design process -- from ideation to creation to product shipment. Because Product Designers leverage both skillsets of research, information architecture, testing of UX professionals as well as the visual know-how of extending a brand in the interface design of UI Designers, it required almost twice the education and experience. 

Product Designers oftentimes own some of all aspects of these job roles: 

*   [Experience Designer (XD) or User Experience (UX) Designer](/tracks/design-phase-0/welcome-to-design-prep/careers/what-is-a-ux-designer)
*   [Information Architect (IA) or Experience Architect (XA)](/tracks/design-phase-0/welcome-to-design-prep/careers/what-is-a-ux-designer)
*   [User Interface (UI) Designer](/tracks/design-phase-0/welcome-to-design-prep/careers/what-is-a-ui-designer)
*   [Interaction Designer (IX)](/tracks/design-phase-0/welcome-to-design-prep/careers/what-is-a-ui-designer)

A better way to look at a Product Designer’s role is through the lens of the product: 

The way a product **feels**, or the **user experience (UX) design** for a product. In other words, the logic behind the product, what it offers to a user and how it makes a user feel throughout the experience.  

The way a product **behaves**, or the **interaction design (IxD)** for a product. This is what the product or interface does when the user interacts with it. Animations, transitions and haptic feedback are part of interaction design.

The way a product **looks**, or the user **interface (UI) design** for a product. Extending the brand into the interface of the product is an important component of UI Design – through typography, color, imagery, layouts, hierarchy, buttons, forms, etc.

The way a product is **structured** and how the content is **organized**, or the product’s **information architecture**. This means mapping out how the user performs and completes a task from the beginning of their journey to the end. Information architecture involves understanding what information a user receives and what experience have along the path from point A to point B. 

So, what are some of the deliverables product designers create? The short answer is any key deliverable from the entire product lifestyle. Some examples are:  

* Competitive analysis
* Journey maps
* Site maps
* Wireframes
* Prototypes
* User testing scripts
* High fidelity designs
* Design systems


## **Part process architect, part user experience expert, part interface designer, Product Designers are involved in:**

* Business strategy
* Research
* Process mapping
* User experience design
* Content strategy
* Information architecture
* Visual design
* User interface design
* Development
* Stakeholder presentations

## [What is a product designer?](https://medium.com/hubspot-product/explain-it-like-im-5-what-is-a-product-designer-121aad98c047l)
by [Henry Wu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hellohenrywu/) (9 min read) <br>Recently, I was fortunate enough to speak at HubSpot’s First Gen in Tech event where I had the chance to talk about what a Product Designer is and what they do at HubSpot. The event was extremely enlightening. Not only did I have the opportunity to inspire many of my future colleagues but I quickly learned that Product Design is shrouded in mystery outside of those who are already in tech. I was overwhelmed by the feedback and quickly learned there are many questions about what a Product Designer actually does.

We don’t think it matters a little, we think it is the core of our value proposition and central to everything we build. It is even reflected in our company’s mission statement.

by [Sarah Klein](http://sarah-klein.com/) (4 min read) <br>One of the best things about working in technology is that things are always changing, including what tech folks’ job titles are. As a design professional, it can be easy to get confused by the different job titles du jour. So what’s the difference between a User Experience Designer and a Product Designer? I had an answer based on past conversations with peers in the field, but after some lightweight data collection and analysis, I was led to think differently.
